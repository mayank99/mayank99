I like CSS, TypeScript and design systems.


Hello there, Mayank; Tobiloba here. I am the Developer Advocate at Million.js and I must say that your article [here](https://www.mayank.co/blog/react-server-components/) really fascinated me and I was mind-blown when I saw how your brutalized Next, React and gave your very valid opinions on many things involved with RSCs and Server Actions. I am a bit curious and I was wondering if you may be interested in having a Coffee chat? Would you be interested maybe?

Sorry for the unconventional means I used, I couldn't find you online anywhere, but, Devpost. Thank you! Happy new year.
